CALL FOR PAPERS 

MIDas4CS 2025 - Third Workshop on the Modelling and Implementation of Digital Twins for Complex Systems


June 16-17, 2025
Vienna, Austria

***************************************************************************** 

The concept of Digital Twin is becoming increasingly popular since it was introduced in the scope of the Smart Industry (Industry 4.0). A Digital Twin (DT) is a digital representation of a physical twin that is a real-world entity, system, or event. It mirrors a distinctive object, process, building, or human, regardless of whether that thing is tangible or non-tangible in the real world. The DT technology provides benefits such as real-time remote monitoring and control; greater efficiency and safety; predictive maintenance and scheduling; scenario and risk assessment; better intra- and inter-team synergy and collaborations; more efficient and informed decision support system; personalisation of products and services; and better documentation and communication. The ultimate purpose of Digital Twins is to improve decision-making for solving real-world problems, by using the digital model to create the information necessary for decision-making and subsequently applying the decisions in the real world. Nowadays, Digital Twins are not limited to industrial applications but are spreading to other areas as well, such as, for example, in the healthcare domain, in personalised medicine and clinical trials for drug development.

This workshop aims at getting a better understanding of the techniques that can be used to model and implement Digital Twins and their applications in different domains. In this workshop, we welcome contributions that aim at introducing formal definitions of Digital Twin, but also contributions that describe applications of Digital Twins in different domains. Contributions on tooling for Digital Twins are also welcome.

The workshop is co-located with the 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE’25).
